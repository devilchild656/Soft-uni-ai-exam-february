# Project Architecture Guidelines
## Vue 3 + TypeScript + Pinia + Tailwind CSS
### Atomic Design + Strict Store Isolation

---

# 🎯 CORE ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES

This project follows:

- Atomic Design (Atoms → Molecules → Organisms)
- Strict separation of UI and business logic
- Store access ONLY inside views
- Fully typed TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for ALL layout & styling
- Scalable and maintainable folder structure
- No business logic inside reusable components

---

# 🧱 ATOMIC DESIGN SYSTEM

We follow Atomic Design methodology:

Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Views

---

## 1️⃣ Atoms

Smallest UI building blocks.

Examples:
- Button
- Input
- Label
- Icon
- Badge
- Spinner

Rules:
- No store access
- No composable usage (unless purely UI-related)
- Fully controlled via props
- Emit events upward
- No business logic
- Tailwind classes only
- No scoped CSS unless absolutely necessary
- Highly reusable

Atoms must be:
- Dumb
- Stateless (or minimal UI state only)
- Fully typed

---

## 2️⃣ Molecules

Combination of atoms forming small UI units.

Examples:
- SearchInput (Input + Icon)
- FormField (Label + Input + Error)
- CardHeader (Title + Action Button)

Rules:
- No store access
- No direct API calls
- No business logic
- Accept props
- Emit events
- Use atoms internally
- Tailwind for layout

Molecules orchestrate UI composition only.

---

## 3️⃣ Organisms

Complex UI blocks composed of molecules and atoms.

Examples:
- UserCard
- UserList
- ImageGallery
- FormSection

Rules:
- No store access
- No direct API calls
- No domain logic
- Receive data via props
- Emit events upward
- Layout done entirely with Tailwind

Organisms can:
- Handle UI state
- Handle UI interactions
- Manage presentation logic only

They CANNOT:
- Call stores
- Fetch data
- Contain business rules

---

# 🏛 VIEWS (SMART LAYER)

Views are the ONLY place allowed to:

- Access Pinia stores
- Call composables
- Trigger API calls
- Contain business logic
- Handle routing logic
- Map store data to UI props

Views act as:

Data Orchestrators

They:
- Fetch data
- Transform data
- Pass data as props to organisms
- Listen to emitted events
- Call store actions

Views must:
- Stay readable
- Not contain large UI markup
- Delegate UI to organisms
